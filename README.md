# fisicaPlatformerGame
A 2D platformer game that features an animated character that tries to reach the locked box in 2 levels

To play the game:
1. Install the Processing application for free on https://processing.org/download/
2. Download the fisicaPlatformerGame repository
3. Open the Fisica_Platformer.pde using the processing application

Please note that this is not the final game. I am still working on fixing aesthetic issues and the display window issue.
