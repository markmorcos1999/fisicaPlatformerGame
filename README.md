# fisicaPlatformerGame
A 2D platformer game that features an animated character (Bruis) that tries to reach the locked box in 2 levels. Bruis must overcome enemies and obstacles using tiles such as gravity switchers and teleporters to escape this maze and win the game!

To play the game:
1. Install the Processing application for free on https://processing.org/download/
2. Download the fisicaPlatformerGame repository
3. Open the Fisica_Platformer.pde using the processing application

Please note that this is not the final game. I am still working on fixing aesthetic issues and the display window issue.
